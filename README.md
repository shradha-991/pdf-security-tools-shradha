# 🔐 PDF Security Tools using Python (GUI Based)

This repository contains two Python GUI-based tools developed during my internship at Inlighn Tech:

1. 📁 [pdf_protector]– A tool to apply password protection on PDF files
2. 📁 [pdf_cracker]– A tool to crack protected PDFs using a dictionary (wordlist) attack

Both tools are developed using Python 3, PyPDF2, and Tkinter, and focus on file-level document security.



## 📌 Tools Overview

### 🔒 PDF Protection Tool
- GUI-based password encryption of PDFs
- Uses PyPDF2's encryption feature
- Allows file browsing and custom password input

### 🔓 PDF Cracker Tool
- GUI-based dictionary attack simulation
- Loads a password-protected PDF and a wordlist
- Attempts decryption using each word
- Displays result: success or failure



## 🧰 Technologies Used
- Python 3.11
- PyPDF2
- Tkinter
- OS module for file handling

## 🎯 Project Purpose
"This repo was created to demonstrate understanding of both protection and cracking techniques for PDF security. 
Each tool works independently and is well-documented with screenshots and reports."
